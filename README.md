UX
----------

The aim is to  make a website that allows the user to easily navigate around the site whilst looking sleek and not over congested.
I want the information to be clear and concise allowing it to be informative yet pleasing to the eye. I wanted the colour scheme to
be vibrant as its purpose is to make the user feel happy and that hey are having a good time  thus matching the aspirations of the venue.

The navigation bar will collspse into a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
