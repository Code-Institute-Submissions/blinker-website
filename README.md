**Blinker Bar - Bar Website**

This website is designed to be shown to potential employers of my services as a web designher mainly aimed at but not exclusively, venue owners and operators in the hospitality sector. 
All the subject matter is supposed to be interchangeable as the bar that I have designed for is fictitious. It is to show the different ways I can promote certain aspects of their business, in an informative yet fun way.

**UX**
----------

The aim is to  make a website that allows the user to easily navigate around the site whilst looking sleek and not over congested.
I want the information to be clear and concise allowing it to be informative yet pleasing to the eye. I wanted the colour scheme to
be vibrant as its purpose is to make the user feel happy and that hey are having a good time  thus matching the aspirations of the venue.


 **Features**
----------

The navigation bar will collspse into a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
I will be using the bootstrap card feature to make a in page navigation menu.

 **Technologies**
----------

 
- Html
- css
- Bootstrap

**Demo**
----------
A live demo can be found here. [here] https://e494f380-bec5-42b5-bb5c-d0d295d9351b.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/




 **Media**
----------

All the photos were donated by Loop Roof bar in Melbourne Australia, Cocktails Beers Ramen and Buns
in Manchester England and from [Regal-Disco] https://www.facebook.com/regaldisco/   also In Manchester England.




All pictures, menus and coy are interchangable and should serve as a demonstration for the client on what a site may look like.
